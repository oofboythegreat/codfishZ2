## 🧠 AP CSA Developer Notes
*This section shows how we aligned to the AP CSA standards.*

* **Encapsulation & Architecture:** All classes use `private` instance variables with `public` getters and setters. We created a class hierarchy where `[Subclass 1]`, `[Subclass 2]`, and `[Subclass 3]` all extend our base `GameObject` class.
* **Polymorphism:** In our main `render()` loop, we call the `.move()` and `.draw()` methods on a list of `GameObject` references, but the specific overridden methods in our subclasses execute at runtime.
* **ArrayList Traversal:** We manage our game entities using an `ArrayList<GameObject>`. We successfully implemented a backwards traversal loop in the `[Insert Method Name]` method to safely remove objects without causing an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* **Standard Arrays & Sorting:** We used a standard 1D array to manage `[Insert Mechanic, e.g., the top 5 high scores]`. We used `[Selection Sort / Insertion Sort]` to order these scores before displaying them on the Game Over screen.
* **File I/O & String Parsing:** Our game saves data persistently to `[filename.txt]`. When the game loads, it reads the file using a `Scanner` and uses String methods like `[substring() / indexOf()]` to parse the saved names and scores.
